                            <p>This case study explores the design solution and creating detailed pages website for making an impactful project that would help to raise awareness, funds and support. The primary goals of this endeavor was to design a user-friendly, engaging, and informative website that appeals to both potential donors and those seeking assistance for children in need. <br>
                            The project was created On Figma and WordPress, inclusive of User Research and Analysis, Design Brief, User Flow Map, Scenario, User Personas, Wireframes and Low and High-fidelity prototypes in a 6-week sprint. I worked on this real-time project as a part of the BCIT Information Architecture Design course in Term 1.</p>

                        <p>During the brainstorming phase, I started by identifying the short-term goals and long-term goals of the “Children International Charity” website.

                            <p>- Raising awareness - by increasing the number of volunteers and participants. I would create a company wristband, so more people can wear it to raise awareness.
                                - Improve customer support - Will implement a live chat available 24 hours, so users can have access any time in any location around the world.</p>

                            <p> - Economic empowerment - the impact of inflation on charities and nonprofits, even though the geological conflicts.
                                - Increasing the size of the charity - it is very critical to expand the size of the charity in different countries and create more branches.
                                - Expand marketing division - I will allocate more resources to the marketing division to boost the popularity of the website and increase its user base in the long term.</p>

                                The first thing I focused on was my research strategy. Understanding the unique UX/UI needs and preferences of Children International's diverse user base, including donors, beneficiaries, and volunteers, is essential to enhance the effectiveness and user satisfaction of the charity's online platforms.
                                To identify the flows in the current UX and UI, I conducted a usability test by interviewing Retired Volunteer and Wealthy Family,  that fit my user archetype. Based on that, I created personas. I found that wealthy families were spending a lot of time browsing different charity websites and trying to understand their interfaces, which motivated me to continue my research.

                                A competitive analysis helped me to explore the possibilities with our client's website.  Great (competitor) design aesthetics, interesting functionality, and sometimes SEO and Social Media Marketing techniques pushed me to design better.  Build better. Art is subjective.  Learning what is aesthetically pleasing and functional, to our client and other users within this industry, gave me insight into what to build into the new site and inspiration to create something better than we analyze.
                                I conducted research on Plan International as a primary competitor for my upcoming website, and I employed Website Grader to enhance both SEO and mobile app performance.

                                I also used Nibbler to test the website. It gave me a report scoring the website out of 10 for key areas, including accessibility, SEO, social media, and technology.

                                International is aiming to provide even better functionality and faceted organization in the navigation. Children International will have improved search engine optimization, by considering using descriptive words or phrases (e.g. News, Donate, Support) and etc.

                                A concept map is a diagram or graphical tool that visually represents relationships between
                                concepts and ideas. The concept map shows the key points during the phrase of reaching client's industry, and
                                how they can be considered when creating a better user experience.

To confirm that I understand the clients requests and articulate to our development team the correct procedure I documented the 'user flow' of the donation process.

                                <p>I developed a comprehensive design system to effectively engage users through appropriate colors and fonts tailored to a Children's Charity Website. This involved creating a more harmonious color palette as the primary focus. I crafted the logo using Illustrator, offering multiple design options that delineated what should and shouldn't be incorporated. To underscore the impact on children, I integrated child imagery into the logo.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Faceted (or navigational) search uses a hierarchy structure (taxonomy) to enable users to browse information by choosing from a predetermined set of categories. This allows a user to type in their simple query, then refine their search options by navigating/drilling down.  Think of "filtering" the search results with categories.
                                    I created 5 facets what could be used to filter and organize the search results on this website:

                                    Metadata is data about data. Search engines, such as Google, do not only "read" the content of
                                    your website, they look at over 200+ signals (within their algorithm) that help them decide where
                                    to place your site in the results. To increase the chances of your content being located in
                                    response to a search engine request, we need to add appropriate metadata, such as a search engine title, description, keywords, copyright and event dates.

                                    <p>During my first term at BCIT, I embarked on my initial Information Architecture and UX research project. Throughout this journey, I acquired a wealth of knowledge in a relatively short span, honing my abilities in task prioritization and the creation of WordPress websites from the ground up. Here are some invaluable takeaways from this experience:</p>
                                    <ol style="padding-left: 40px; font-size: 20px;">
                                        <li>
                                            Prioritize Diverse Thinking: It became clear that dedicating excessive time and effort to an initial design is not advisable. Instead, I learned to embrace diverse thinking as a pivotal stage in the design process.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Harness the Power of Competitive Analysis: Conducting thorough competitive analyses of prominent Charity Foundations proved instrumental in discerning current trends, understanding user expectations, and pinpointing areas ripe for improvement.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Leverage Existing Research: I discovered that an extensive body of research already exists on best practices in charity UX. It's crucial to tap into this valuable resource to inform and enhance one's work.
