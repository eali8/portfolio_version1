                                    The main objective was the opening of a new branch of Fufu Bakery in Vancouver Downtown, attracting a new target audience and increasing sales. <br>
                                    Fufu Bakery already has a thriving bakery situated in the Brentwood area, serving as a strong foundation for the brand's reputation and success. "Fufu" also aims to increase its web visibility and increase the number of events it attends monthly. This was a fictitious company for a Project with BCIT. I have worked, as a UX / UI Designer and Project Manager of a group of three people.

                                    Fufu Bakery, an established brand renowned for its success in the Brentwood area, is embarking on a strategic expansion into Vancouver Downtown. The primary objective is to not only open a new branch but also to attract a distinct and diverse target audience while significantly increasing sales.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In parallel, Fufu Bakery acknowledges the imperative need to elevate its digital footprint. This entails enhancing web visibility and accessibility to create a compelling online presence that mirrors the excellence and warmth associated with the physical bakery. Moreover, the company is intent on broadening its monthly event portfolio to forge deeper connections with the community.

                                <p>
                                    I conducted comprehensive market research to understand the demographics, preferences, and behaviors of the Vancouver Downtown audience. Also I developed detailed user personas that summarized the characteristics and needs of the target audience. I implemented a feedback system that encourages customers to provide input on their experiences, both in-store and online. These strategic actions collectively contributed to a successful solution, enhancing the expansion of Fufu Bakery and significantly elevating its web visibility

                                            Cameron is Canadian, originally from Saskatchewan, moved to Vancouver 4 years ago. She has a very busy schedule with investment banking and high-profile of investors. Very often, she needs to run for early meetings and is great for her to stop by Fufu and grab her favorite coffee and pastry. Fufu is in a great location in Lower Mainland, exactly next to her office in Burrard. She is a loyal customer of Fufu Bakery, and extremely happy with their expansion.

                                            As a part of our Competitive Analysis, I undertook an in-depth examination of three prominent bakeries located in the Lower Mainland Vancouver area. This analysis involved a comprehensive assessment of their presence in the Apple App Store, an evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses, and a careful study of their market research strategies. This thorough examination provided valuable insights that have been instrumental in shaping the development of Fufu Bakery. It allowed me to pinpoint key areas of focus and improvement based on the competitors' practices and performance.

                                            Following this initial competitive analysis phase, I proceeded to create an interview guide, through which I conducted interviews with five individuals who fell within my target demographic. These interviews formed the basis for the development of User Personas, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of the  potential customers. <br>
                                            The target audience for Fufu Bakery encompasses a diverse range of individuals, including families, coffee enthusiasts, local residents, office professionals, small and large corporate entities, students, and anyone with an appreciation for freshly baked pastries and coffee. By delving into their responses and analyzing their behaviors, I've been able to refine the strategies and offerings to better cater to the preferences and needs of this broad and dynamic audience.

                                                I created an empathy map that enabled me to visualize the thoughts, feelings, and perspectives of Fufu Bakery's customers. My focus was on understanding what Cameron, our typical customer, says, thinks, feels, needs, and experiences in terms of both gains and pains. This exercise was instrumental in gaining insights into our customers' experiences, allowing me to identify areas for improvement in Fufu’s products, services, and communication strategies, with the ultimate goal of better meeting our customers' needs and addressing their emotions.

                                    My choice of the color orange was deliberate, as it closely aligns with the delightful hues often found in pastries. Orange is a color that invokes feelings of warmth, energy, and creativity, making it a perfect fit for the project. The resulting color palette harmoniously blends warm and neutral tones, creating an inviting and visually appealing experience for the Fufu Bakery website.
                                    Incorporating burnt orange allowed me to infuse vitality into specific design elements, serving as attention-grabbers. Meanwhile, the use of a pristine white background was pivotal to ensuring readability and maintaining a clean and polished appearance. The inclusion of brown and light beige tones further added a comforting and earthy dimension, fostering a warm and welcoming ambiance for the bakery's online presence.

This outcome underscored my commitment to delivering a top-notch digital platform that aligned with the unique needs and preferences of my target audience.

                                    During my UX research, my primary focus was on creating a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing website with the main goal of enhancing its online visibility and increasing the frequency of monthly event attendance. To achieve this, I employed user testing methods, utilizing tools such as InVision and Figma to collect valuable feedback. Subsequently, I incorporated user feedback by implementing changes in font styles and background colors in the subsequent iteration of the design. These refinements were made with the aim of improving the overall user experience and driving the desired outcomes for the website.
